Key features include:

✅ Display all user tasks  
🔍 Local task search  
➕ Create new tasks  
✏️ Edit existing tasks  
🗑️ Delete tasks  
📦 Move tasks between different status levels

### ⏳ Task Status Levels

## ⚙️ Technical Specifications

### ✨ API Configuration

A **Postman collection** is provided for testing API calls.

### 🔑 Environments

The Angular project uses **environment files** for configuration:
- `src/environments/environment.ts` → for development
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` → for production

Example `environment.ts`:

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'API_URL',
  apiKey: 'API_KEY',
  jwtToken: 'YOUR_JWT_HERE',
  userId: 'USER_ID'
};

```
